Solution
let P be the perimeter of each shape.
the area of each shape is:
• circle: P²/4π
• equilateral triangle: √3 P²/36
• square: P²/16
so the ""area outside the shapes"" is the largest. it's infinite. https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1771774122164453821 https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1771796115479749078/photo/1","1"
